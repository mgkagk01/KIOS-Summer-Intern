# KIOS-Summer-Intern

This repository inlcudes all the code implemented during my intership at KIOS Research Center (https://www.kios.ucy.ac.cy/) during the Summer 2017.
The discription of the intership is given below

Simulated the basic modulation schemes such as, BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM to investigate their performance over an AWGN channel.
Implemented:
* 1) the Alamouti (2x1) space-time block code when the channel is flat fading
* 2) a transmission of BPSK symbols over a frequency selective channel using  OFDM
* 3)  the Alamouti (2x1) when the channel is frequency selective and use OFDM to transmit data in parallel, utilizing MATLAB.
