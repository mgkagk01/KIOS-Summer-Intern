# KIOS-Summer-Intern

This repository includes all the code implemented during my internship at KIOS Research Center (https://www.kios.ucy.ac.cy/) during Summer 2017.
The description of the internship is given below.

Simulated the basic modulation schemes such as, BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM to investigate their performance over an AWGN channel.
Implemented:
* The Alamouti (2x1) space-time block code when the channel is flat fading
* A transmission of BPSK symbols over a frequency selective channel using  OFDM
* The Alamouti (2x1) when the channel is frequency selective and use OFDM to transmit data in parallel

The scripts added or will add in the future are

* BPSK_AWGN.m
